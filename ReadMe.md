'''
Always try to make more than 4 pull requests.
Let's assume you have made only 4 pull requests to different projects.
but one project is excluded from the hacktoberfest event.
Then your pull request will not be counted and you will only have 4 valid pull requests.
If this happens then you will not get any swags or the t-shirts
